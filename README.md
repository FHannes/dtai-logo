DTAI Logo
=========

This repository contains a set of vectorized logo's for the [DTAI (Declarative Languages and Artificial Intelligence) group](https://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/) at the [Univerity of Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/kuleuven/).

These logos are the property of the DTAI group.

As I was unable to find any vector graphics for the DTAI logo to use in my master's thesis, I decided to make my own. The logo is available in four different types and two file formats for each type.
